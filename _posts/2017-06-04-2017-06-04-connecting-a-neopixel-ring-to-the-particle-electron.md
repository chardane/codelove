title: Connecting a Neopixel Ring to the Particle Electron
---

I've always wanted to play around with circuits, and this year's [Twilio Hackpack](https://hackpack.cc/) got me thinking that maybe I should really get on it. Thanks for showing it to me, [@cassidoo](http://cassidoo.co/)! ‚ù§Ô∏è

So, I got a Particle Electron - it's a microcontroller with a built-in 3G module *and* its own data plan. [Check it out](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/electron-cellular-dev-kit), it's pretty awesome.

And then I wanted to play around with something fun, so I got a [Neopixel Ring with 16 pixels](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1463). There's a [Neopixel library](https://github.com/technobly/Particle-NeoPixel) that you can directly use with Particle's boards, so I figured this would be *easy-peasy*.

I should mention that I know next to nothing about circuits or hardware in general. My greatest hardware achievement was when I once made light bulbs light up in *parallel circuits*. Exciting.

After setting up the electron, I found that there was no straightforward guide out there for the simplest way to connect the Neopixel to the Electron. People talked about logic level converters and boost converters (are those the same thing?). Hence, this guide was born.

# *If you mostly know software, don't know how to solder things and like pretty lights, you've come to the right place.*

I'll show you some tips on how to setup your brand new Electron and how to hook it up to your Neopixel Ring so you can run a simple light animation. This guide assumes you are familiar with the command line.

## What you'll need
1. Particle Electron (the kit with the antenna and battery)
2. Two half breadboards (the Electron comes with one)
3. Jumper wires, minimum of 4. I think it's good to have plenty of these around.
4. Neopixel Ring, 16 pixels.

I got the Particle Maker Kit which contained the other half-breadboard and the jumper wires (wires with both male tips). These are the twist-tied bunch of wires, *not* the colorful wires stuck together that you have to pull apart (those have one male tip and one female tip. idk what they're called.).

## Step 1: Go to particle.io/start

Select the big Electron image. You'll get to this page, but you'll actually want to go to the "Introduction" page, and not this "Getting Started" guide yet.

![Don't Get Started here.](images/posts/getting-started-nah.png)
*Protip: click on the Introduction link (green arrow above)*

In the "Introduction" page, look for the ["SETUP MY ELECTRON"](https://setup.particle.io/) link and follow the steps. Or you can just click that link. It requires a credit card, so get that ready too.

You'll also need to connect the antenna. I was a little scared of forcefully pushing in this delicate looking piece of metal, but it'll be fine. *I wish someone told me this.*

You can continue with the rest of their guides, it's actually really helpful to get a better feel of things (like what the pins do and how to blink an LED). Come back when you're ready to connect your Neopixel to the Electron.

## Step 2: Install Particle CLI

You'll need this to be able to flash your code directly to your device through USB. Because you have to pay for that data, you'll want to flash directly so you don't waste it. You can follow Particle's guide, or just run these two commands for now.

Make sure to install `npm` if you haven't yet.
```
$ npm install -g particle-cli
$ particle login
```
Login with your Particle account, and let's move on!

## Step 3: Connect your Neopixel!

Ok, this is the entire point. I learned a lot from Core Electronics' [Using Neopixels with Particle](https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/using-neopixels-with-particle.html), but in that guide they describe how to connect to the Neopixel ring *kit* with the Photon. And they describe using a logic level converter on a breadboard, which I'll learn about later, but right now I really just want to see my first pixel light up. They do have a cool portion there that zooms into Neopixels and how they can produce different colors, so definitely check that out too.

I don't know how to solder, and I found out that you can simply use a breadboard to connect to the Neopixel pins! üò±

![Neopixels on Breadboard](images/posts/breadboard-yay.JPG)
*Yay! I'll eventually solder these but what a great idea.*

There are also some wire color conventions you can follow to build a good habit.
1. Red -> Power
2. Black/Blue -> Ground
3. Any other color -> Data

And here's the wiring diagram! I put this diagram together with the help of my friend Abhinav (also known as Pun Master).

![Wire Diagram](images/posts/neopixel-and-electron.jpg)
*I've been looking for this treasure map*

When wiring this up with the Electron powered, *always connect Ground (GND) first*. Pun Master recommends this order when connecting:
1. Ground (GND)
2. Data (D6)
3. Power (VIN)

Follow the reverse order when disconnecting.

Now, we should note that this setup has a couple of caveats:
1. The Neopixels will only light up when you have power connected to the USB.
2. You probably should not set all the pixels to full white brightness while in this configuration.

Since we're going to be flashing our code directly through USB, this will let us see something light up right away. Here's a photo of this setup:

*It took a lot of googling and asking for me. Hope you got to this faster.*

## Step 4: The code!

Now we're back in familiar territory. Since you've already installed Particle CLI from Step 2, we can either use Particle Dev (their Desktop IDE) or just go to the [Build Web IDE](https://build.particle.io/build/new) and copy pasta this code that lights up the first (0th) pixel on the ring. It also sets the brightness pretty low, so that we don't explode. (Just kidding, we won't explode. Hopefully.)

```
#include "neopixel/neopixel.h"

// IMPORTANT: Set pixel COUNT, PIN and TYPE
#define PIXEL_COUNT 16
#define PIXEL_PIN D6
#define PIXEL_TYPE WS2812

Adafruit_NeoPixel strip = Adafruit_NeoPixel(PIXEL_COUNT, PIXEL_PIN, PIXEL_TYPE);

void setup() {
  strip.begin();
  strip.show();
}

void loop() {
  // Light up the first pixel
  strip.setPixelColor(0, 50,50,50);
  strip.show();
  delay(500);
}
```
